# Google Summer of Code - 2018.

> Project Ideas, resources and collaboration guide for freeCodeCamp's GSoC projects in 2018.

[freeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org) is nonprofit that helps millions of people learn to code for free. We are applying for [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC) as a mentor organization in 2018.

If you are a student, then we have some challenging, widely-used projects for you to work on this summer.

### What is Google Summer of Code (GSoC)?
Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. 

Students work with an open source organization on a 3-month programming project during their break from school.

To learn more about the program and its eligibility requirements, [visit GSoC’s page here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/).

### freeCodeCamp’s participation in GSoC.
We will list projects you can participate [on this page](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/google-summer-of-code-ideas-list/170155). Students will be able to take part in any of those for the year 2018. It will evolve over the coming days, and will be overseen by [Mrugesh Mohapatra](https://github.com/raisedadead).

**As a student**, this will help you gain experience working on a real world platform that millions of people use each month as they work through our free open source web development curriculum and earn our standardized certifications.

**As a mentor**, you can help students build some substantial projects that will lead to make learning to code a more fun, interactive experience for millions of learners.

> Note: The mentoring organizations [will be announced by February 12, 2018](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline). We will update this page as and when more information is available.

> You can still join us [as a contributor](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/), regardless of the of our participation in GSoC or your eligibility in the program.
