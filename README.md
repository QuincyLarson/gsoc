# Google Summer of Code - 2018.

> Project Ideas, resources and collaboration guide for freeCodeCamp's GSoC projects in 2018.

[freeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org) is a nonprofit that helps millions of people learn to code for free. We are applying for [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC) as a mentor organization in 2018.

If you are a student, then we have some challenging, widely-used projects for you to work on this summer.

### What is Google Summer of Code (GSoC)?
Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. 

Students work with an open source organization on a 3-month programming project during their break from school.

Learn more about GSoC and its eligibility requirements [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/).

### freeCodeCampâ€™s participation in GSoC.
We will list projects you can participate in on [this page](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/google-summer-of-code-ideas-list/170155). Students will be able to take part in any of these in 2018. It will evolve over the coming days, and will be overseen by [Mrugesh Mohapatra](https://github.com/raisedadead).

**As a student**, you will gain experience working on a real-world platform used by millions of people each month as they work through our free, open source web development curriculum and earn our standardized certifications.

**As a mentor**, you can help students build substantial projects that will contribute to making learning to code more fun and  interactive for millions of users.

> Note: The mentoring organizations [will be announced by February 12, 2018](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline). We will update this page as and when more information is available.
>
> You can still join us [as a contributor](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/), regardless of our participation in GSoC and of your eligibility in the program.
